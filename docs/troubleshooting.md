# Troubleshooting

When creating your project you may encounter problems, that may occur when developing it (eg. in the IDE), or when you preview/play it. This page will help you identify them, and give you best practices to fix them.

## Step 1. Identify from where is coming the problem

If your problem doesn't involve your game/application being ran/previewed, that means it's highly probable it's coming from the IDE. So jump directly to Step 2: IDE issues.
